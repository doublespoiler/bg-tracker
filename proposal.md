# Capstone Proposal

**Name of Student**: Skylan Lew

**Name of Project**: Board Game tracking application (name tba)

**Project's Purpose or Goal**: A React application for tracking personal board game collections, with Boardgame Atlas integration for searching games

**List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:**

* Successfully search/view BGAtlas API by name, mechanics, players, weight, score(s), base/expansion
* Allow the user to add, remove and wishlist games to their collection
* Save state to local storage
* Save collection backup
* Import collection backup
* Platform: Web

**What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to _your_ track, and _your_ language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.**

Languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript

* Platform: React native

**What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?**

API: React Native
